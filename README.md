  abstract     = {PECCAVI introduces a novel distortion-free watermarking scheme resilient to visual paraphrasing attacks, where an image’s semantics are preserved but styling is changed. Through dual-space embedding and signal-preserving transformations, PECCAVI achieves over 90% watermark robustness under various paraphrasing attack scenarios, while maintaining visual fidelity.}
